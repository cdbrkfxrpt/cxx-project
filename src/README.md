... you put your code. You can of course change the directory structure in any
way you see fit, although having and `include` and a `thirdparty` directory
_somewhere_ in your project might be useful. If you're building a library, keep
in mind that people will have a much easier time if they can just use your
directory structure as is (inside their `thirdparty` directory) and point their
`include_directories` at **one** location, i.e., and `include` directory.
